## [Sobey's Customers and Products Analysis](https://github.com/SamarthGupta2/Data-and-Text-Mining-Coursework/tree/master/Sobeys%20Customer%20and%20Products%20Data%20Clustering%20Analysis)
- Algorithm: K-Means Clustering 
- Programming Language: R
- Analyzed customer and product sales data of Sobey's superstore to categorize customer and products in clusters based on purchase patterns and product characteristics
- Recommended strategies to boost the sales for each customer and product cluster

## [Customer Decision Classification](https://github.com/SamarthGupta2/Data-and-Text-Mining-Coursework/tree/master/Customer%20Decision%20Classification)
- Algorithms: Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-fold Cross validation
- Studied the decision of customers to purchase a car based on the features available in the car
- Created Decision Tree, Random Forest and K-fold Cross Validation trained models and visualized each model for better understanding of area under the curve (AUC) and accuracy.
- Identified the best model by comparing the accuracy achieved by passing the test data to each trained model.
